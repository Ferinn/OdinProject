            <li>Eggs, 4</li>

            <li>Heat the milk in a pot until warm (do not boil). Stir in vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs with 100 g sugar until smooth.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg mixture while whisking to avoid curdling.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the caramel-coated molds.</li>
            <li>Place the molds in a baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until halfway up the molds.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 160°C for about 50–60 minutes, until set.</li>
            <li>Put it into the fridge over night, then invert onto plates before serving.</li>
